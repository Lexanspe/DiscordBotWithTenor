Sending Tenor gifs using discord.js 

When an user uses the "/gif 'character'", the code searchs for 50 'character' gifs at Tenor and replies with one of them. (You can change the value at the end of the line 26. Also don't forget the max value is 50.)

To run this code, you must put your Tenor token in ${process.env.TENORKEY} or you can simply create a .env file and put your Tenor token in that file like the way I did:
TENORKEY = (your-tenor-token)

You MUST NOT USE quotes if you put your token in .env file.
But if you would like to put your token in ${process.env.TENORKEY}, you must use quotes then.

Now you can send gif by using your bot!
